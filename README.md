# Brain IoT Tutorials

This repository holds the Brain IoT Tutorials. They are maintained as markdown and turned into HTML by [Jekyll][jekyll].



## Git Submodules

The project uses git submodules (so it can include content from other projects).

After you have cloned the repository, you need to initialise git submodules as follows:

```
$ git submodule initÂ 
$ git submodule update
```

### Include up-to-date content

To show full source files in the tutorials, they could each be copied to `_includes`, but then risk becoming out-of-date if the source is updated.

It's better to reference them directly in their git repository, by adding a git submodule:

```
git submodule add../fabric-systems.git _includes/fabric-systems
```

The full content of the `fabric-systems` git repository will then be available in `_includes/fabric-systems`.

## Run Locally

To Install Jekyll, you need the ruby gem command:

```shell
$ sudo gem install bundler jekyll
```

To run Jekyll locally:

```shell
$ ./run.sh
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```
You can now browse to <http://127.0.0.1:4000> to see the site, which is automatically regenerated as you change the files.

## Deploy

[.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml) is configured to build the site when the master branch is updated. However, the BRAIN-IoT GitLab is not configured to publish GitLab pages, so the site currently has to be deployed manually.

The generated Jekyll site is in `_site` and can be deployed to any web server.

The site currently uses *absolute* links for some resources, which will break if not deployed to the web server root. This should be fixable by making the offending links *relative*.

A workaround is to use `wget` to make the site relative:

```
wget --recursive --no-clobber --page-requisites --html-extension --convert-links  --exclude-domains localhost http://127.0.0.1:4000
```
